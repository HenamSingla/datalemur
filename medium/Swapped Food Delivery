Zomato is a leading online food delivery service that connects users with various restaurants and cuisines, allowing them to browse menus, place orders, and get meals delivered to their doorsteps.

Recently, Zomato encountered an issue with their delivery system. Due to an error in the delivery driver instructions, each item's order was swapped with the item in the subsequent row. As a data analyst, you're asked to correct this swapping error and return the proper pairing of order ID and item.

If the last item has an odd order ID, it should remain as the last item in the corrected data. For example, if the last item is Order ID 7 Tandoori Chicken, then it should remain as Order ID 7 in the corrected data.

In the results, return the correct pairs of order IDs and items.

orders Schema:
column_name	type	description
order_id	integer	The ID of each Zomato order.
item	string	The name of the food item in each order.
orders Example Input:
Here's a sample of the initial incorrect data:

order_id	item
1	Chow Mein
2	Pizza
3	Pad Thai
4	Butter Chicken
5	Eggrolls
6	Burger
7	Tandoori Chicken
orders Example Output:
The corrected data should look like this:

corrected_order_id	item
1	Pizza
2	Chow Mein
3	Butter Chicken
4	Pad Thai
5	Burger
6	Eggrolls
7	Tandoori Chicken
Order ID 1 is now associated with Pizza and Order ID 2 is paired with Chow Mein. This adjustment ensures that each order is correctly aligned with its respective item, addressing the initial swapping error.

Order ID 7 remains unchanged and is still associated with Tandoori Chicken. This preserves the order sequence ensuring that the last odd order ID remains unaltered.

My Solution:

-- SELECT order_id as corrected_order_id,
-- COALESCE(case when order_id%2 != 0 then lead(item)over(order by order_id)
--               when order_id%2 = 0 then lag(item)over(order by order_id)
-- end,item) as item 
-- FROM orders 


SELECT 
  case 
    when mod(order_id, 2) = 1 and order_id = (select max(order_id) from orders) then order_id
    when mod(order_id, 2) = 1 then order_id + 1 
    when mod(order_id, 2) = 0 then order_id - 1 
    else null
  end as corrected_order_id, 
  item
FROM orders 
order by 1
